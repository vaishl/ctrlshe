I'm in the process of creating a social media site for gamer girls to find gamemates to play with! 

The problem with a lot of gamemate matching sites such as LFG discords or gankster groups is the rampant amount of toxicity towards marginalized groups. as a woman i've experienced lots of this so I decided to create a website where girl gamers can play with each other! 

I'm experimenting with how to make the backend for the website, so I'm using python flask in this iteraction.
